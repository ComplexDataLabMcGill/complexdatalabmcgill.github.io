I am a master student at Mila and McGill University, supervised by Professor Reihaneh Rabbany and Professor Guillaume Rabusseau. Previously I obtained an Honours in Computer Science from McGill University in 2019. My current research focus on anomaly detection in graph data using tensor factorization techniques. I have also worked on integrating autoML techniques into continual learning settings.
